First, let's find out how many eggs are laid by the ducks in a day. Since Janet has 16 ducks and they lay 16 eggs per day, the total number of eggs laid is:
\[ 16 \text{ ducks} \times 16 \text{ eggs/duck} = 256 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs eaten for breakfast (3 eggs) and the number of eggs baked (4 eggs):
\[ 256 \text{ eggs} - 3 \text{ eggs} - 4 \text{ eggs} = 229 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Each egg is sold for $2, so the total revenue from selling the eggs is:
\[ 229 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/egg} = 458 \text{ dollars/day} \]

   - The number of downloads in the second month is three times the downloads in the first month.
     \[

There are two types of fibers: blue and white. The problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, and half as much white fiber. To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the number of bolts for each type separately and then add them together.

First, let's determine the number of bolts of blue fiber. According to the problem, there are 2 bolts of blue fiber. So, the first part is straightforward: 2 bolts.

Next, we need to find out how many bolts of white fiber are required. The problem says that half as much white fiber is needed. Since the problem doesn't specify exactly what ""half"" means, we'll assume that the white fiber is half the quantity of blue fiber. Therefore, if 2 bolts of blue fiber require 2 bolts of white fiber, then half of that would be 1 bolt of white fiber. Adding this to the original 2 bolts of blue fiber gives us 3 bolts in total.

Adding these together, the total number of bolts is 2 (blue) + 3 (white) = 5 bolts.

To do this, we can multiply $5 by 0.6 (since 60% is equivalent to 0.6 in decimal form). Let me calculate that:

$5 * 0.6 = $3

So, the first glass costs $3. Now, the total cost for all 16 glasses would be the sum of the prices of both glasses. Let's add those together.

The first glass costs $3, and there are 16 glasses. So, the total cost would be:

To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we first need to understand the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass (i.e., the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.) costs 60% of $5. 

Let's calculate the cost of each second glass:
- Cost of the 2nd glass = 60% of $5 = 0.6 * $5 = $3
- Cost of the 4th glass = 60% of $5 = 0.6 * $5 = $3
- And so on...

We can see that the cost for each second glass is $3.

Next, we need to account for all 16 glasses. There are 8 pairs of second glasses in 16 glasses (since every second glass forms a pair). Therefore, we have 8 glasses at $3 each and 8 glasses at $5 each.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost of 8 second glasses = 8 * $3 = $24
- Cost of 8 first glasses = 8 * $5 = $40

1. **First Month Downloads**: The problem states that the program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads**: The number of downloads in the second month is three times the first month's downloads. Therefore, we calculate the second month's downloads as follows:
   \[
   \text{Second Month Downloads} = 3 \times \text{First Month Downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads**: In the third month, the number of downloads is reduced by 30% from the second month's total. To find the third month's downloads, we need to calculate 70% of the second month's downloads (since 100% - 30% = 70%). The calculation is:
   \[
   \text{Third Month Downloads} = 0.7 \times \text{Second Month Downloads} = 0.7 \times 180 = 126

To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for a robe, we first need to understand the quantities required for each type of fiber. The problem states that a robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. It also mentions that the robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. 

We can calculate the amount of white fiber needed by taking half of the blue fiber:
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \) bolt

Next, we add the amounts of both types of fibers to find the total number of bolts required:
- Total bolts: Blue fiber + White fiber
- Total bolts: 2 bolts + 1 bolt = 3 bolts

Therefore, the robe requires a total of 3 bolts of fiber.

To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass (i.e., the third, fifth, seventh, etc.) costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first glass:
- Cost of the first glass = $5

For the remaining 15 glasses, since every second glass costs $3, we can divide these into two groups: one group of 7 glasses that are priced at $5 each and another group of 8 glasses that are priced at $3 each.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost for 7 glasses priced at $5 each = 7 * $5 = $35
- Cost for 8 glasses priced at $3 each = 8 * $3 = $24

Adding these together gives us the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost for the first glass + Cost for 7 glasses + Cost for 8 glasses
- Total cost = $5 + $35 + $24 = $64

Thus, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:** The program had 60 downloads.
2. **Second Month:** The number of downloads is three times the first month's downloads.
   \[
   60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads}
   \]
3. **Third Month:** The number of downloads is reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads.
   - First, find 30% of 180 downloads:
     \[
     0.30 \times 180 = 54 \text{ downloads}
     \]
   - Then subtract this amount from the second month's downloads:
     \[
     180 - 54 = 126 \text{ downloads}
     \]

Now, we sum up the downloads from all three months:
\[
60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \text{ downloads}
\]

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366.

To determine how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $49.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Total cost for pants = 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.

Finally, to find the total amount Mishka spent, we add up the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Thus, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items.
